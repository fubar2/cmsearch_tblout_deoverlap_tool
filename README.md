Suggestions appreciated.


## Tool made with the Galaxy ToolFactory: https://github.com/fubar2/galaxy_tf_overlay

Importing the Galaxy history in this repository into a ToolFactory instance will allow you to "redo"
the generating job and update anything you want. If you want a new tool, change the tool_id.
Otherwise a new version will be created and ready to distribute.
Keep that updated history because it's the easiest way to adapt the tool starting with the original ToolFactory form.
