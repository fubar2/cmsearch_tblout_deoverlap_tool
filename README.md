Suggestions appreciated.


## Tool made with the Galaxy ToolFactory: https://github.com/fubar2/galaxy_tf_overlay

Importing the Galaxy history in this repository into a ToolFactory instance will allow you to "redo"
the generating job and update anything you want. Use the "raw" link - NOT the direct link from the "code" page - click on it and  you will see a "raw" download page - use that "raw" URL for that binary tar.gz file in the Galaxy ToolFactory history import form.

If you want a new tool, change the tool_id.
Otherwise a new version will be created and ready to distribute.
Keep that updated history because it's the easiest way to adapt the tool starting with the original ToolFactory form.
